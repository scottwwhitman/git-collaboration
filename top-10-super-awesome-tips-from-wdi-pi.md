# Top 10 Super Awesome Collaboration Tips from WDI Pi

1. Plan Naming conventions together

2. Share your GIFT (Don't be afraid to speak up) =)

3. When you have your "MVP" feature working, push to master & make sure nothing breaks before perfecting/adding final touches

4. Get at least 2 people to review branch before pushing to master

5. If using a staging / dev branch, make it testable so you can find bugs <u>before</u> merging into master

6. **COMMUNITCATION!!!**

7. **SCRUM**

8. **DRY** Code = #goals

9. <u>Take Breaks!</u> Moments of Zen.

10. Break work up proportionately so that everyone owned and contributed a feature!
